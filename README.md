# BirdBox - Training Wild Birds to Clean the Environment

The BirdBox project is an innovative approach to environmental cleanup that trains wild birds to collect litter in exchange for food. This project combines environmental conservation with animal intelligence, creating a sustainable way to help clean our environment while engaging with local wildlife.

## Overview

The BirdBox is a device designed to train wild crows to pick up litter and deposit it into a designated container in exchange for food rewards. This project leverages the natural intelligence and adaptability of corvids (crows and ravens) to create a mutually beneficial relationship between humans and birds while addressing environmental pollution.

## How It Works

The system works on a simple principle: when a bird deposits litter into the collection area, it triggers sensors that activate a food dispenser, rewarding the bird with a treat. Over time, birds learn to associate cleaning up litter with receiving food rewards, creating a sustainable cycle of environmental cleanup.

## Project Goals

- Create a sustainable solution for environmental cleanup
- Engage wild birds in a meaningful way that benefits both wildlife and humans
- Raise awareness about environmental issues and animal intelligence
- Demonstrate how technology can be used to create innovative solutions for environmental challenges

## Community Impact

This project not only helps clean the environment but also:
- Creates awareness about environmental pollution
- Demonstrates the intelligence of wild birds
- Provides a unique way for communities to engage with local wildlife
- Offers an educational opportunity to learn about animal behavior and environmental conservation
